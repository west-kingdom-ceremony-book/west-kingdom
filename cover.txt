Photo credit would be nice if its convenient with the format of the project.
Please use any of the photos I have posted in the SCA groups.  You have cart
blanch permission and need not ask again.  I would love to see an end copy
of your project when its released and would be happy to find one of my
photos in it, if deemed worthy...if not...then possibly on a future project. 
Feel free to look at the 4 albums of SCA photos I have on my main page and
to use any of those you may feel are appropriate.

Best wishes on a very successful project.

ER Bazor
